Hello!

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast from India, currently pursuing my **Master's in Computer Science** at **Boston University Metropolitan College**, specializing in **security**. My interests lie in **Linux, Network Security, Security Protocols, and Cryptographic Algorithms**, among others.  

I hold a **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering** from **IIT Bombay**, where I graduated with **Honors**. During my time there, I worked under the guidance of **[Dr. Virendra Sule](https://iitb.irins.org/profile/11184)** on **Black Box Techniques for Cryptographic Inversions**.  

I recently earned the **Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) Certification** from **ISC2** and am currently preparing for the **[Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa)** certification, along with **[Qualys Vulnerability Management Foundation](https://www.qualys.com/training/course/vulnerability-management-foundation/)** and other security certifications.  

## Outside of Work  
When I need a break, you'll often find me **exploring Bostonâ€™s historic trails**, such as near the **Reservoir** or **Boston Commons**. I believe in balancing physical and mental exercises.  

## Hobbies & Interests  
I enjoy **tinkering with GNU/Linux**, listening to music, reading books, and playing indie games. Some books Iâ€™ve read include:  

- ðŸ“– **[Countdown to Zero Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18465875-countdown-to-zero-day)** â€“ *Kim Zetter*  
- ðŸ“– **[The Prince](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28862.The_Prince)** â€“ *NiccolÃ² Machiavelli*  

I also watch anime, read manga & light novels, and play games like:
